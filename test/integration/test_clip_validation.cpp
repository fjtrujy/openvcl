// Regression test: CLIP rejects an obviously malformed operand
//
// TODO.md previously documented that CLIP operands were present
// but not properly validated.  In practice the parser was already
// emitting "Invalid argument" diagnostics for them; the missing piece
// was Error::HasErrors() bubbling up into the exit code so callers
// could actually see the failure.  Both halves are now in place.
//
// This test pins the working behavior end-to-end:  a malformed CLIP
// must produce a non-zero exit AND a stderr diagnostic that mentions
// "Invalid argument" with the offending operand.

    // The leading tabs matter: openvcl's tokenizer rejects directives that
    // start in column 0 with "Invalid characters", which would mask the
    // CLIP diagnostic we're actually testing for.
